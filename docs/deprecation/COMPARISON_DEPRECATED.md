# Deprecated: Architecture Comparison

This document has been deprecated and moved to the archival section.

**Reason for deprecation:**  
The content in this file overlapped with `docs/architecture/agentic_architecture.md` and was superseded by the consolidated architecture overview. Keeping it alongside the new architecture documentation would cause redundancy.

**What to use instead:**  
- Refer to [`docs/architecture/agentic_architecture.md`](./../architecture/agentic_architecture.md) for the current, comprehensive overview of the agentic architecture.
- For historical reference, the original content is archived in this file but will no longer be updated.

**Migration path:**  
1. Update any internal links pointing to this file to point to `docs/architecture/agentic_architecture.md`.  
2. Remove references to this file from READMEs or other navigation indexes.
